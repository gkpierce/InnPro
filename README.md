Research Relating to U.S. Exonerations and Wrongful Incarcerations

All research conducted by Gavin Pierce, in support of efforts by Nayak Polissar and The Mountain-Whisper-Light consulting firm. 

Data from The National Registry of Exonerations at the University of Michigan is used for research. This data requires agreeing to conditions set forth by the NRE prior to viewing.
This agreement can be found here:

Additionally, data from the Bureau of Justice Statsitics has been used for research. Data from this source spans multiple years and has been employed in a variety of fashions.
Specifically, we are using the "Prisoners" data set to track incarcerations by state across years. As an example, the data from 2021 can be found here:
